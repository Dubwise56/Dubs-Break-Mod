# Dubs-Break-Mod
Changes how mental breaks are triggered, e.g. for an extreme break a pawn has to have at least 1 extreme -20 thought, rather than a few small niggles.

I don't like the way that a pawn can go on a murder spree just because they slept without a table in the cold while in pain from a nat bite in the dark wearing a shirt with 1 little hole in it. I think they should have at least 1 seriously bad thought to allow the serious mental breaks to trigger.

The thresholds for each level of break can be adjusted in the mod settings

The mod also allows lower level mental breaks to trigger if a bad enough thought isn't present to trigger the more extreme ones
